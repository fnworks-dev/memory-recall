**Portable memory for AI assistants.** Give any AI instant context about your codebase.

## 🤖 For AI Assistants

> **IMPORTANT**: If you're an AI assistant (ChatGPT, Claude, Cursor, etc.), read this first.

### Before Starting Any Task

```bash
recall load                    # Get project overview: stack, key files, structure
```

### Before Modifying ANY File

```bash
recall deps <filename>         # See what imports this file AND what depends on it
```

This prevents breaking changes. The `deps` command shows:
- 🔽 **Imports** - What this file uses
- 🔼 **Imported by** - What files depend on this (CRITICAL for avoiding breaks)
- ⚠️ **Change impact** - How many files could be affected

### Quick Reference

| When | Command | Why |
|------|---------|-----|
| Starting session | `recall load` | Get full project context |
| Before editing | `recall deps <file>` | See dependencies + impact |
| Looking for code | `recall find "query"` | BM25-ranked search |
| Check what changed | `recall diff` | Files modified since last pack |

## 🚀 Install

```bash
# Clone and install globally (works like gh/vercel CLI)
git clone https://github.com/fnworks-dev/memory-recall.git
cd memory-recall
pip install .

# Now 'recall' works from anywhere
recall --help
```

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
# Pack your project
recall pack ~/projects/myapp --name myapp

# Get context for AI (paste into ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
recall load
```

That's it. Your AI now knows your project.

## 📖 Commands

### Project Management
```bash
recall pack <path> --name <alias>   # Pack a project
recall list                          # List all projects
recall use <alias>                   # Switch projects
recall update                        # Re-pack current project
```

### Context for AI
```bash
recall load                    # Output context
recall load --at "2026-01-05"  # Time-travel to past state
recall show                    # View full details
```

### Dependencies & Search
```bash
recall deps <file>             # Show imports AND what depends on this file
recall deps supabase           # Partial names work! Finds lib/supabase/client.ts
recall deps --top              # Show top 10 most-depended-on files
recall find "query"            # BM25-ranked search
recall diff                    # Changes since last pack
```

### Notes
```bash
recall describe "description"  # Set project description
recall note "decision"         # Log a decision
recall session "topic"         # Log session topic
```

### History
```bash
recall history                 # View past snapshots
recall queries                 # View search history
recall entity <file>           # View TODOs from code
```

---

## 🔄 Typical Workflow

### 1. Starting a Session
```bash
$ recall load

# Project: myapp
Stack: React, Next.js, Supabase, TypeScript
371 files, 96,987 lines

## Directory Overview
- components/ (253 files) - UI components
- pages/ (61 files) - Page routes
- lib/ (28 files) - Core libraries
...
```

### 2. Before Editing a File
```bash
$ recall deps lib/auth.ts

📁 lib/auth.ts
   🔽 Imports (3 dependencies):
      ← ./supabase
      ← ./types
   🔼 Imported by (12 files):
      → pages/login.tsx
      → pages/dashboard.tsx
      → components/ProtectedRoute.tsx
      ...
   ⚠️  Change impact: 12 files depend on this
```

### 3. Searching for Code
```bash
$ recall find "authentication"

📁 Files (ranked by relevance):
   lib/auth.ts (0.85)
   pages/login.tsx (0.72)

⚡ Functions:
   useAuth
   validateToken
```
